# Assets Directory

This directory contains image assets for the extension:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 icon for extension
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 icon for extension
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 icon for extension

For development, you'll need to add these image files to this directory.

For simple testing, you can use placeholder images or create simple icons using an online icon generator.
